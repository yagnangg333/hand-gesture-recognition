# Hand Gesture Recognition using MediaPipe

A real-time hand gesture recognition system built with [MediaPipe](https://mediapipe.dev/) and [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/).  
It detects hands, tracks 21 landmarks per hand, and classifies gestures based on landmark positions.

## Features
- ðŸŽ¯ Real-time hand tracking and gesture detection
- âœ‹ 21 hand landmarks extracted using MediaPipe Hands
- ðŸ¤– Easy to customize with your own gestures
- ðŸš€ Lightweight and fast â€” works on CPU
- ðŸ“· Live webcam support (can be extended to videos/images)

## How It Works
1. **Hand Detection**: Detects hands in the video feed using MediaPipeâ€™s palm detector.
2. **Landmark Extraction**: Extracts 21 3D landmarks for each detected hand.
3. **Gesture Recognition**: Classifies the gesture based on the spatial relationship between landmarks.
4. **Action Mapping**: Trigger actions or events based on the recognized gesture.

## Technologies Used
- [MediaPipe Hands](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/hands)
- [OpenCV-Python](https://opencv.org/)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
